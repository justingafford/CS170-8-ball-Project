# CS170-8-ball-Project
All code copied over from my work on https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler#, which is a online compiler which I used to write,test and debug my code. This code is using Python 3. This is the 8-puzzle CS170 Project in which we use Heuristic algorithms in order to simulate artificial intellegence so we can solve 8-puzzles.
